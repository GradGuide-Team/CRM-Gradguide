c# Funnel Analytics Dashboard Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Funnel Analytics Dashboard implementation in the GradGuide CRM system. The dashboard provides real-time insights into student application stages, document completion rates, visa processing, and distribution analytics.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Components
- **Analytics Endpoint**: `/v1/students/analytics`
- **CRUD Function**: `get_student_analytics()` in `server/crud/student.py`
- **Data Aggregation**: MongoDB queries with role-based filtering

### Frontend Components
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Main dashboard with multiple funnel views
- **Funnel Chart Component**: Reusable chart component with interactive features
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for analytics data
- **Navigation Integration**: Added to sidebar navigation

## Stage Determination Logic

### Overall Student Stage Classification
The system determines a student's overall stage based on the following priority:

1. **Finalized**: Any university choice has status "Uni finalized"
2. **Visa Phase**: Visa counselling has started
3. **Offer Received**: Any university choice has conditional/unconditional offer
4. **Application Phase**: Any university choice is in application pending/filed status
5. **Document Collection**: Default stage for new students

## Funnel Views Available

### 1. Application Path Distribution
Shows distribution of students across different application paths:
- Direct
- SI (Study International)
- Eduwise

### 2. Student Journey Stages
Overall progress tracking through the application process:
- Document Collection → Application Phase → Offer Received → Visa Phase → Finalized

### 3. Document Completion Status
Individual document tracking:
- Passport, Marksheets, English Exam, SOP, LOR, Resume

### 4. University Application Status
Detailed university application tracking:
- Documents pending → Documents received → Application pending → Application filed → Offers → Finalized

### 5. Visa Decision Status
Visa application outcomes:
- Pending, Accepted, Rejected

### 6. Visa Process Steps
Detailed visa process tracking:
- Counselling started → Documents received → Application filled → Interview scheduled

### 7. Country Distribution
Target country preferences

### 8. Counselor Distribution
Workload distribution across counselors

## Technical Implementation Details

### Route Ordering (CRITICAL)
The analytics endpoint MUST be placed before the generic `{student_id}` route:

```python
# CORRECT ORDER:
@router.get("/students/analytics")        # Specific route first
@router.get("/students/{student_id}")     # Generic route after

# WRONG ORDER (causes 404):
@router.get("/students/{student_id}")     # This catches "analytics" as ID
@router.get("/students/analytics")        # Never reached
```

### Role-Based Access Control
Analytics respects user roles:
- **Admin users**: See all students
- **counselor users**: See only students they created

### Performance Considerations
- Data is cached for 5 minutes on frontend
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- MongoDB queries are optimized for role-based filtering
- Aggregation happens in-memory after fetching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. 404 Not Found Error
**Symptoms:** `/v1/students/analytics` returns 404
**Causes:**
- Route ordering issue (analytics route after {student_id} route)
- Server not restarted after changes
**Solution:**
- Ensure analytics route is before {student_id} route
- Restart FastAPI server

#### 2. Empty Data
**Symptoms:** Analytics loads but shows no data
**Causes:**
- No students in database
- Role-based filtering excluding all students
- Database connection issues
**Solution:**
- Check server logs for debug messages
- Verify user role and permissions
- Ensure students exist in database

#### 3. Frontend Loading Issues
**Symptoms:** "Failed to load analytics data"
**Causes:**
- Backend endpoint not accessible
- Authentication issues
- Network connectivity
**Solution:**
- Check browser network tab
- Verify authentication token
- Check server logs

### Debug Information
The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
- User ID and role making request
- Number of students found
- Data processing steps
- Error details with full traceback

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Drill-down functionality**: Click segments to see detailed student lists
2. **Date range filtering**: Analyze data for specific time periods
3. **Export capabilities**: PDF/Excel report generation
4. **Real-time notifications**: Alerts for bottlenecks or issues
5. **Comparative analytics**: Month-over-month comparisons
6. **Advanced filtering**: By counselor, country, date range

### Technical Improvements
1. **Database indexing**: Optimize queries for large datasets
2. **Caching layer**: Redis for improved performance
3. **Streaming updates**: WebSocket for real-time data
4. **Data warehouse**: Separate analytics database

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor performance**: Check query execution times
2. **Review logs**: Identify any recurring errors
3. **Update documentation**: Keep this file current with changes
4. **Test functionality**: Verify analytics accuracy periodically
